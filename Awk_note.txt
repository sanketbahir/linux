> Example:
> awk '{print}' staff.txt => it will print all file data
> awk  '/manager/  {print}' staff.txt => it will print those who has  post manager 
> awk '{print ,}' staff.txt => we use this conmmand to  print the column of file
> awk '{print ,}' staff.txt =>  command print the last column of the file 
> awk 'NR==3, NR==6  {print NR,bash}' staff.txt =>  using NR command like this we can print the rows of file

awk '{print NR "- " $1}' classes.txt
this command will print the column name with the column data

awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max  = length($0)} END  {print max}' classes.txt
this command will  print the logest  line that is present in our file

awk 'END {print NR }' classes.txt
this command will  tell  as  about how many rows of data in our file

awk 'length($0) > 10' classes.txt
this cmd will print those lines who has more than 10 character
